# Enhancements Tracking and Backlog

Enhancement tracking repository for OpenShift Pipelines.

Inspired by the
[Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements),
[OpenShift](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements) and
[Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/tree/main/teps)
enhancements process.

This repository provides a rally point to discuss, debate, and reach consensus
for how OpenShift Pipelines [enhancements](./enhancements) are introduced.
OpenShift Pipelines combines Tekton components with a broad set of ecosystem
components in order to provide an enterprise ready CI/CD distribution built
for extension.

Enhancements may take multiple releases to ultimately complete and thus provide
the basis of a community roadmap.  Enhancements may be filed from anyone in the
community, but require consensus from domain specific project maintainers in
order to implement and accept into the release.
